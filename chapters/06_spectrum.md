# The Spectrum

An alternative representation of the covariance generating function of $y$ is the
**spectrum** of the $y$ process. Recall the covariance generating function of $y$
defined in {eq}`eq-4`,

$$
g_y(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_y(k)\, z^k.
$$

For the process $y_t = B(L)\epsilon_t$, we have seen that
$g_y(z) = B(z)B(z^{-1})\sigma_\epsilon^2$.
If we evaluate {eq}`eq-4` at the value $z = e^{-i\omega}$, we have

```{math}
:label: eq-28
g_y(e^{-i\omega}) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_y(k)\, e^{-i\omega k}, \qquad -\pi < \omega < \pi.
```

Viewed as a function of angular frequency $\omega$, $g_y(e^{-i\omega})$ is called the
**spectrum** of $y$. The spectrum is the Fourier transform of the covariogram.

## Inversion of the Spectrum

As we would expect from the inversion formula {eq}`eq-20`, the spectrum is itself a
kind of covariance generating function. Given an expression for $g_y(e^{i\omega})$ it is
easy to recover the covariances $c_y(k)$ from the inversion formula {eq}`eq-20`. To
motivate the inversion formula, we multiply {eq}`eq-28` by $e^{i\omega h}$ and integrate
with respect to $\omega$ from $-\pi$ to $\pi$:

```{math}
:label: eq-29
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g_y(e^{-i\omega})\, e^{i\omega h}\, d\omega
= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_y(k)\, e^{i\omega(h-k)}\, d\omega
= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_y(k) \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i\omega(h-k)}\, d\omega.
```

Now for $h = k$, we have $\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i\omega(h-k)} d\omega = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} 1\, d\omega = 2\pi$.
For $h \neq k$, we have

$$
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i\omega(h-k)}\, d\omega
= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos\omega(h-k)\, d\omega
+ i\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin\omega(h-k)\, d\omega = 0.
$$

Therefore, {eq}`eq-29` becomes

$$
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g_y(e^{-i\omega})\, e^{i\omega h}\, d\omega = 2\pi\, c_y(h).
$$

Thus multiplying the spectrum by $e^{i\omega h}$ and integrating from $-\pi$ to $\pi$
gives the $h$th lagged covariance times $2\pi$. In particular, for $h = 0$:

$$
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g_y(e^{-i\omega})\, d\omega = 2\pi\, c_y(0) = 2\pi \cdot \text{Var}(y),
$$

so that the area under the spectrum from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ equals $2\pi$ times the variance
of $y$. This fact motivates the interpretation of the spectrum as a device for decomposing
the variance of a series by frequency. The portion of the variance of the series occurring
between any two frequencies is given by the area under the spectrum between those two
frequencies.

## Properties of the Spectrum

Notice that from {eq}`eq-28` we have

```{math}
:label: eq-30
g_y(e^{i\omega}) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_y(k)\, e^{i\omega k}
= c_y(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_y(k)(e^{i\omega k} + e^{-i\omega k})
= c_y(0) + 2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_y(k)\cos\omega k.
```

According to {eq}`eq-30`, the spectrum is **real-valued** at each frequency and is
obtained by multiplying the covariogram of $y$ by a cosine function of the frequency in
question. Notice also that since $\cos x = \cos(-x)$, it follows from {eq}`eq-30` that

$$
g_y(e^{i\omega}) = g_y(e^{-i\omega}),
$$

so that the **spectrum is symmetric** about $\omega = 0$. Since
$\cos(\omega + 2\pi k) = \cos(\omega)$, $k = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$, it follows that
the spectrum is a **periodic** function of $\omega$ with period $2\pi$. Therefore, we can
confine our attention to the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$, or even $[0, \pi]$ by virtue of
the symmetry.

Incidentally, the preceding calculations can be used to prove that the spectrum is always
**nonnegative**. Suppose that the spectrum $g_x(e^{-i\omega})$ is negative over a small
band. Then choose a filter that shuts off all variance outside this band. The result is
to produce a new random process that has a negative variance, a contradiction. So the
spectrum must be nonnegative.

## The Fundamental Filtering Formula

We now derive a fundamental formula linking the spectrum of one covariance stationary
process $y_t$ to the spectrum of another covariance stationary process $x_t$. We suppose
that both $\{x_t\}$ and $\{y_t\}$ have zero mean and consider the projection equation

$$
y_t = \sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} b_j x_{t-j} + \epsilon_t \equiv B(L)x_t + \epsilon_t,
$$

where $E\epsilon_t x_{t-j} = 0$ for all $j$. Here $B(L)x_t$ is the projection of $y_t$
on the entire $x$ process. We then have that

$$
y_t y_{t-j} = \left(\sum_{s=-\infty}^{\infty} b_s x_{t-s}\right)
              \left(\sum_{r=-\infty}^{\infty} b_r x_{t-j-r}\right)
+ \left(\sum_{s=-\infty}^{\infty} b_s x_{t-s}\right)\epsilon_{t-j}
+ \left(\sum_{r=-\infty}^{\infty} b_r x_{t-j-r}\right)\epsilon_t
+ \epsilon_t\epsilon_{t-j}.
$$

Taking expected values of both sides and applying the orthogonality conditions gives

$$
c_y(j) = E(y_t y_{t-j})
= \sum_{s=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{r=-\infty}^{\infty} b_s b_r c_x(j+r-s) + c_\epsilon(j).
$$

The spectrum of $y$ is defined as

```{math}
:label: eq-31
g_y(e^{-i\omega}) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_y(k)\, e^{-i\omega k}
= \sum_{k,s,r} b_r b_s\, c_x(k+r-s)\, e^{-i\omega k} + g_\epsilon(e^{-i\omega}).
```

Define the index $h = k+r-s$, so that $k = h-r+s$. Notice that

```{math}
:label: eq-32
e^{-i\omega k} = e^{-i\omega(h-r+s)} = e^{-i\omega h}\, e^{i\omega r}\, e^{-i\omega s}.
```

Substituting {eq}`eq-32` into {eq}`eq-31` gives

$$
g_y(e^{-i\omega})
= \sum_{r} b_r e^{i\omega r}
  \sum_{s} b_s e^{-i\omega s}
  \sum_{h} c_x(h) e^{-i\omega h}
+ g_\epsilon(e^{-i\omega})
= B(e^{i\omega})\, B(e^{-i\omega})\, g_x(e^{-i\omega}) + g_\epsilon(e^{-i\omega}),
$$

or

```{math}
:label: eq-33
g_y(e^{-i\omega}) = \left|B(e^{-i\omega})\right|^2 g_x(e^{-i\omega}) + g_\epsilon(e^{-i\omega}).
```

This is an important formula that shows how the spectrum of the "input" $x$ is multiplied
by the nonnegative real number $|B(e^{-i\omega})|^2$ in composing the spectrum of $y$.

Formula {eq}`eq-33` can be used to analyze the effects of **filtering**, in which we
start with a covariance stationary random process $x_t$ and define a new process

```{math}
:label: eq-34
y_t = B(L)x_t,
```

so that formula {eq}`eq-33` applies with $g_\epsilon(e^{-i\omega}) \equiv 0$.

## Ideal Bandpass Filter

Formula {eq}`eq-34` motivates the interpretation of the spectrum as decomposing the
variance of $y$ by frequency. Suppose we could choose $B(e^{-i\omega})$ so that

```{math}
:label: eq-35
B(e^{-i\omega}) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \omega \in [a,b] \cup [-b,-a], \quad 0 < a < b < \pi, \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
```

A filter obeying {eq}`eq-35` shuts off all the spectral power for frequencies not in the
region $[a,b]$ or $[-b,-a]$. To determine a set of $b_j$ that satisfies {eq}`eq-35`,
we use the inversion formula:

```{math}
:label: eq-36
b_j = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} B(e^{-i\omega})\, e^{+i\omega j}\, d\omega
= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{a}^{b}(e^{i\omega j} + e^{-i\omega j})\, d\omega
= \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\frac{\sin jb - \sin ja}{j}\right), \qquad j \neq 0,
```

Note that $b_j = b_{-j}$. With the $b_j$ chosen in this way, the $y$ process defined by
$y_t = \sum_j b_j x_{t-j}$ has all of its variance occurring in the frequency bands
$\omega \in [a,b]$, $\omega \in [-b,-a]$. The variance of $y$ is given by

$$
\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g_y(e^{-i\omega})\, d\omega
= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-b}^{-a} g_x(e^{-i\omega})\, d\omega
+ \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{a}^{b} g_x(e^{-i\omega})\, d\omega.
$$

In this sense $g_x(e^{-i\omega})$ gives a decomposition of the variance of $x$ by
frequency, the variance occurring over a given frequency band being found by integrating
the spectrum over that band and dividing it by $2\pi$.

As we shall show presently, the decomposition of the variance of $x$ by frequency that
is reflected in the spectrum is one in which components at different frequencies can be
regarded as orthogonal. More precisely, two components formed by applying two filters
like {eq}`eq-35` that let through power over disjoint frequency bands are mutually
orthogonal at all lags.

## Spectra of Simple Processes

**White noise** ($y_t = \epsilon_t$, $c_y(0) = \sigma_\epsilon^2$, $c_y(h) = 0$ for
$h \neq 0$): The covariance generating function is simply $g_y(z) = \sigma_\epsilon^2$,
so that the spectrum is

$$
g_y(e^{-i\omega}) = \sigma_\epsilon^2, \qquad -\pi \leq \omega \leq \pi.
$$

The spectrum is **flat**, and equals $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ at each frequency. So white
noise has a flat spectrum, indicating that all frequencies between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ are
equally important in accounting for its variance.

**First-order AR** ($y_t = (1/(1-\lambda L))\epsilon_t$, $-1 < \lambda < 1$): The
covariance generating function is $g_y(z) = (1/(1-\lambda z))(1/(1-\lambda z^{-1}))\sigma_\epsilon^2$,
so the spectrum is

$$
g_y(e^{-i\omega})
= \left(\frac{1}{1-\lambda e^{-i\omega}}\right)\!\left(\frac{1}{1-\lambda e^{i\omega}}\right)\sigma_\epsilon^2
= \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}{1 - 2\lambda\cos\omega + \lambda^2}.
$$

Notice that

$$
\frac{dg_y(e^{-i\omega})}{d\omega}
= -(1-2\lambda\cos\omega+\lambda^2)^{-2}(2\lambda\sin\omega)\,\sigma_\epsilon^2.
$$

The first term in parentheses is positive. Since $\sin\omega > 0$ for $0 < \omega < \pi$,
the second term is negative on $(0,\pi)$ if $\lambda < 0$ and positive on $(0,\pi)$ if
$\lambda > 0$. Therefore:

- If $\lambda > 0$: spectrum **decreases** on $(0,\pi)$; low frequencies are relatively
  important in composing the variance.
- If $\lambda < 0$: spectrum **increases** on $(0,\pi)$; high frequencies are the more
  important.

It is easy to verify that the higher in absolute value is $\lambda$, the steeper is the
spectrum. Notice that the first-order process can have a peak in its spectrum only at
$\omega = 0$ or $\omega = \pm\pi$. A peak at $\omega = \pi$ corresponds to a periodicity
of $2\pi/\omega = 2\pi/\pi = 2$ periods. A peak at $\omega = 0$ corresponds to a cycle
with "infinite" periodicity, which is unobservable and hence not a cycle at all.

With quarterly data, a business cycle corresponds to a peak in the spectrum at a
periodicity of about 12 quarters. A first-order process is capable of having a peak only
at two quarters or at "infinite" quarters, and so is not consistent with a business cycle
in the sense of a peak in the spectrum at about twelve quarters. As we saw above, a
first-order process cannot possess a covariogram with a periodicity other than two
periods, and so with quarterly data cannot deliver a business cycle in the sense of an
oscillatory covariogram.

**Second-order AR** ($y_t = (1-t_1L-t_2L^2)^{-1}\epsilon_t$, $\epsilon_t$ white noise):
The covariance generating function is

$$
g_y(z) = \left(\frac{1}{1-t_1z-t_2z^2}\right)\!\left(\frac{1}{1-t_1z^{-1}-t_2z^{-2}}\right)\sigma_\epsilon^2.
$$

Therefore the spectrum is

$$
g_y(e^{-i\omega}) = \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}
  {1 + t_1^2 + t_2^2 - 2t_1(1-t_2)\cos\omega - 2t_2\cos 2\omega}
\equiv \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}{h(\omega)}.
$$

Differentiating with respect to $\omega$:

$$
\frac{dg_y(e^{-i\omega})}{d\omega}
= -\sigma_\epsilon^2 h(\omega)^{-2}
  (2\sin\omega)\bigl[t_1(1-t_2) + 4t_2\cos\omega\bigr].
$$

We know that $h(\omega)^2 > 0$. For the above derivative to be zero at an $\omega$
belonging to $(0, \pi)$, we must have the term in brackets equal zero:

```{math}
:label: eq-37
t_1(1-t_2) + 4t_2\cos\omega = 0 \qquad\text{or}\qquad
\cos\omega = \frac{-t_1(1-t_2)}{4t_2},
```

so that

```{math}
:label: eq-38
\omega^* = \cos^{-1}\!\left(\frac{-t_1(1-t_2)}{4t_2}\right).
```

Equation {eq}`eq-38` can be satisfied only if

```{math}
:label: eq-39
\left|\frac{-t_1(1-t_2)}{4t_2}\right| < 1,
```

since $|\cos x| \leq 1$ for all $x$. By inspecting the second derivative of
$g_y(e^{-i\omega})$ with respect to $\omega$, it can be verified that at the $\omega$
given by {eq}`eq-38` there is a **peak** in the spectrum if $t_2 < 0$ and a **trough**
if $t_2 > 0$. Condition {eq}`eq-39` is slightly more restrictive than the condition that
roots of the deterministic difference equation be complex so that the covariogram displays
oscillations. Let us write {eq}`eq-39` as

```{math}
:label: eq-40
-1 < -t_1(1-t_2)/4t_2 < 1.
```

The boundaries of the region {eq}`eq-40` are

```{math}
:label: eq-41
-t_1(1-t_2) = 4t_2
```

and

```{math}
:label: eq-42
-t_1(1-t_2) = -4t_2.
```

The points $(t_1, t_2) = (0,0)$ appear on both boundaries, while $(t_1, t_2) = (2,-1)$
appears on {eq}`eq-41` and $(t_1, t_2) = (-2,-1)$ appears on {eq}`eq-42`.
Differentiating {eq}`eq-41` implicitly with respect to $t_1$ gives
$dt_2/dt_1 = (t_2-1)/(4-t_1)$, so that along {eq}`eq-41`,
$dt_2/dt_1|_{t_1=t_2=0} = -1/4$ and $dt_2/dt_1|_{t_1=2,t_2=-1} = -1$.
Differentiating {eq}`eq-42` with respect to $t_1$ gives
$dt_2/dt_1 = (1-t_2)/(4+t_1)$, so that along {eq}`eq-42`,
$dt_2/dt_1|_{t_1=t_2=0} = 1/4$ and $dt_2/dt_1|_{t_1=-2,t_2=-1} = 1$.

Such calculations show that the boundaries of region {eq}`eq-40` are as depicted in
Figure 2. To be in region {eq}`eq-40` with $t_2 < 0$ (the case in which the stationary point
is a spectral peak rather than a trough) implies that the roots of the difference equation are
complex. However,
complex roots do not imply that {eq}`eq-40` is satisfied. Consequently, the conditions
for an oscillatory covariogram are not quite equivalent with those for a spectral peak.

To illustrate the ability of low-order stochastic difference equations to generate
"realistic" data, Figures 1a and 1b show simulations of first- and second-order
stochastic difference equations, while figure 1c shows the solution of the deterministic
part of the same second-order difference equation with initial conditions $y_0 = y_1 = 1$.
Notice that even the first-order stochastic difference equation

$$
y_t = 0.9\, y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t,
$$

$\epsilon_t$ a serially uncorrelated random term, appears to generate roughly alternating
periods of boom and bust. This illustrates how stochastic difference equations can
generate processes that "look like" they have business cycles even if their spectra do
not have peaks on $(0, \pi)$ and even if their covariograms do not oscillate.
